# Mistward

A larger mist-repelling building. Similar to the waywards you find running around the mistlands. This one is more powerful, and requires some more expensive components.

## Features

This mod adds a buildable mist disperser that pushes mist further away and is configurable in cost and how far it disperses the mist.

This was originally going to be added as part of [Valheim Fortress](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/MidnightMods/ValheimFortress/) but I thought it might be nice by itself.

## Roadmap Items/ideas
These are not ordered.

- Live modification of configuration values (Recipe & demister range)
	- demister range changes require the piece to be rebuilt or a server restart right now
- Mid-mistlands progression demister improvement
- Optional fuel and configuration for fueling
